 exercise you should practice working with global variables.
To do this, you should develop a program that uses a global variable to manage an account. There should be methods for depositing and withdrawing from the account. aside from that
there should still be a method that outputs the account balance of the account.
Your task is as follows:
• Declare a global variable of type float and initialize it with 0.
• Create a method of depositing into an account, using this method the amount
as a float parameter.
• Create a method of withdrawing money from an account that also does the
Receives amount as a float parameter. This method is intended to check whether there is enough
There is money in the account, otherwise an error message should be issued and the
Account balance cannot be changed.
• Create a method to return the balance.
• A management for the account is to be implemented in the main method. First
should always be asked for the desired operation (1 = deposit, 2 = payout, 3 = show account balance, 4 = end).
When paying in or out, the amount should then be read and finally the respective
Operation to be performed.
If the operation has been completed, should start again from the beginning and after the
next desired operation will be asked. An invalid operation is chosen
(i.e. a number greater than 4, 0, a negative number) should be repeated directly after the desired
Surgery will be asked. The case that no number is entered does not need to be dealt with
will.
